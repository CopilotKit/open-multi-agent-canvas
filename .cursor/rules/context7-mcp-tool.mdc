# Context7 MCP Tool Usage Rule

When using the context7 MCP tool, especially the `get-library-docs` action, always set the `tokens` parameter to **5000 or greater**. This is required to avoid errors and ensure successful documentation retrieval.

## Example (Correct Usage)

```json
{
  "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/mem0ai/mem0",
  "tokens": 5000
}
```

## Best Practices
- Never set `tokens` below 5000 for `get-library-docs`.
- If specifying a topic, include it as a string, but always set `tokens` to at least 5000.
- Update any tool call templates or scripts to default to `tokens: 5000` or higher.

## Reference
This rule is enforced to comply with the requirements of the context7 MCP tool and prevent repeated errors in documentation retrieval.
